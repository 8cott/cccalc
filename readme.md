# Listings App - Client Side

This is a closing costs calculator for NYC real estate that I built to help me figure out closing costs for NYC real estate sales for buyers and sellers of condos, co-ops, and townhouses.

It is still a work in progress and closing costs cannot be calculated accurately until your attorney issues a closing statement, so it should not be used by the public to calculate closing costs.

I intend to add detailed descriptions to each of the input fields and style it to make it look nicer.
